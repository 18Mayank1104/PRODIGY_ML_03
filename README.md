**PRODIGY INTERNSHIP - MACHINE LEARNING**

I would like to express my gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with the opportunity to work on these projects and for their invaluable support and guidance throughout my internship journey. Here are the tasks I completed:

## Task 3: Cat vs Dog Classification
- Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.
- Used the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) Cats vs Dogs dataset.
- Preprocessed, resized, and normalized images before training the SVM model.
- Tested the model on a sample image to demonstrate its classification capabilities.
